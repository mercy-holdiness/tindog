tindog mock up website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

Here I have created the mock up website tindog which uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap v5 at a beginner/intermediate level. The website was a project in The Complete Web Development Course 2021 by Dr. Angela Yu. 

I have made adjustments so that the site is more responsive and mobile friendly!
